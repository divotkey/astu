/*! \mainpage AST Utilities (Full-API)
 * 
 * The original idea to use this library in combination with the lectures 
 * **Applied Software Engineering**, **Interaction and Game Programming**, 
 * and **Game Architecture** from the Media Engineering and Design
 * (Bachelor's program) and Interactive Media (Master's program) at the 
 * University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. The library has been extended 
 * with more and more functions so that it is now a valuable collection of tools 
 * for mathematics, computer graphics, digital audio processing, and last but 
 * not least for computer game development. All in a manageable and limited 
 * scope and purpose, but still quite useful.
 * 
 * All this has been developed to produce didactically illustrative source code. 
 * Therefore, one or the other design decision has been made in favor of
 * readability, while performance has not been completely ignored.
 * 
 * @section ack_section Acknowledgement
 * 
 * I want to extend a big thank you to Nora Loimayr for her significant help in
 * many design decisions. She is the instructor of the exercises in the
 * **Applied Software Engineering** course. Therefore she not only has to use 
 * this library but also explains it to others.
 * 
 * I would also like to thank my students, who are ultimately the target
 * audience, the beta testers, and the library users.
 * 
 * @section hist_sect Version History
 * This library is continuously updated and extended. The version history
